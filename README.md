# MADBLOX rewrite in ASP.NET
> [!NOTE]
>  NOTE:This was made officialy by the owner but he(yomi) was too lazy to develop on it and called it "hard" :skull:

Before you start,you must:
- Have IIS enable with all ticks called "ASP.NET" enabled
 - Have mental patience

 ### To yomi:
 You are a imbecile that allways said to his userbase you would rewrite in fact you **didnt**.
 This source code will be **public** for everyone and *will be hosted on a Azure VPS*.
